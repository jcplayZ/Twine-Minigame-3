I added a ton of if macros so if you reenter a room it isnt just the same text entirely alongside a few macros to check for conditionals like if you have enough coins or the key.
While i could have probably used a passage for each change it would have been redundant at some point and its easier to look at when using if macros rather than entirely new passages, for a coin check it would have been super useless for an
entirely new passage to be made for a single few lines.
